## [Caravan Insurance](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Insurance+Company+Benchmark+(COIL+2000))


This dataset contains 9822 customer data records for an insurance company. Per possible customer, 86 attributes are given: 43 socio-demographic variables, and 43 variables about ownership of other insurance policies.

### Objective

The feature of interest is **whether or not a customer buys a Caravan insurance**. This task will be to predict whether someone will buy a caravan insurance policy.

### Exploratory data analysis

This will entail exploratory data analysis. Visualising the data should give some insight into certain particularities of this dataset. 
 
### Model building

Then data needs to be prepared for regression analysis. It will be important to select the right features, or to construct new features from existing ones.

## [SF Police Department Incidents](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incidents/tmnf-yvry)


This dataset contains incidents derived from SFPD Crime Incident Reporting system showing data from 1/1/2003 up until 1/8/2018.

### Objective

Possible goals for prediction might include,

1. Category of crime likely to occur in a given location, day-of-the-week and time-of-day.
2. Predict the number of crimes for a given category that will be resolved by given police district in each of the following years: 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 (note that there is no data for 2018 to validate results against!).

### Exploratory data analysis

EDA would include time-series visualization of crime by category and location with the aim of answering goals in the objective. 
 
### Model building

An appropriate subset of data will have to be determined and prepared of regression analysis. Important features need to be selected for predictions as per the objective.
