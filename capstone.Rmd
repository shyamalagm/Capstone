## [Black Friday](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/black-friday/)

### Problem Statement
A retail company "ABC Private Limited" wants to understand the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month.

### Dataset
This dataset contains 12 features and 550068 observations for one month. Features include customer demographics (`age`, `gender`, `marital status`, `city_type`, `stay_in_current_city`), product details (`product_id` and `product category`) and `total purchase_amount`.  The dataset does not seem to require much cleaning. It contains a few missing values across the observations.  

### Approach
The goal is to explore the data and identify key features of interest which will guide in building of a regression model. The model response is the purchase amount of customer. This model is intended for creating personalized offers for customers against different products.


## [Walmart - Store Sales Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting)

### Problem Statement
In this problem, job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. Selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset.


### Dataset
This dataset is split across three files containing information on the stores (3 features and 45 observations), sales from each store (5 features and 421570 observations) and relevant information (12 features and 8190 observations) for each store. This excercise will involve much data cleaning. Information regarding holidays must also be incorporated. A lot of visual inspection using plots is required prior to model building.

### Approach
The goal is to build a regression model to predict the sales of each department. Impact of markdowns and holidays must be taken into account.

## [Loan Prediction](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/)

### Problem Statement
Dream Housing Finance company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. 

### Dataset
This is a comparitively smaller dataset with only 614 observations and 13 features. However, this requires extensive amount of data munging which involve cleaning and taking care of missing information. Exploratory data analysis is also required to select the appropriate features for building the model.

### Approach
The aim is to build a regression model to identify customers segments that are eligible for loan amount so as to specifically target those customers. It will be interesting to see which social indicators/factors have the largest effect on the model prediction.
